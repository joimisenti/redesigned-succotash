        <h3>The How</h3>
        <img src="../gifs/capy_poke.gif" alt="Gif of chibi capybara being poked" id="capy-poke">
        <p>Navigate to the Colors page to create your own mood labels associated with your own choice of colors.</p>
        <p>Visit My Day to visualize your mood, poke around, and satisfy your sensory stimulation for how you might be feeling today.</p>
        <p>Head to the Calendar to enter your moods for each day. Look back on your history, see where you've been, and how far you've come.</p>
        <h3>The Why</h3>
        <p>This website was inspired by Mood Tracker pages, particularly those originating from Bullet Journals (BuJos).</p>
        <img src="../gifs/capy_read.gif" alt="Gif of capybara reading" id="capy-read">
        <p>BuJos subverted the one-size-fits-all approach of the traditional planner. They have a remarkable capacity for customization to suit anyone's individual need, which adapts for neurodivergence and personal preference to help you stay on track of your own organizational goals.</p>
        <p>The only drawback that causes many to falter is the time and effort required. This webpage was designed with that in mind.</p>
        <p>The Mood Tracker helps to debunk your own cognitive bias regarding your own well-being, to undo that vague idea of "it's been a rough/awful/bad week or month or year." The tracker is an explicit and self-evident bird's-eye-view that you're likely doing better than you think, more good days than bad.
        </p>
        <p>As an extension of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and mindfulness practices, you provide the irrefutable proof from your own documented experience, and you have the most power to change your own mind.</p>
